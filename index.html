        <h2>ü§è A bit about me</h2>
        <p>
          I was fortunate enough to travel the world, visiting countries from
          Sweden to Malta and from Turkey to Kyrgyzstan. Through this
          experience, I developed a deep love for learning new languages. Due to
          various life circumstances, I have studied Swedish, German, Spanish,
          and English, and am currently taking Korean classes.
        </p>

        <p>
          My free time, which is often short, I spend with my wife and friends,
          playing video games or traveling.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to my technical skills, my diverse work experience also
          makes me a great team player with good stress tolerance and the
          ability to work efficiently. As a Bachelor's Thesis, I designed and
          implemented an integrated information security system for the
          physical, software, and legal layers. As a Masters Thesis, I created a
          neural network that protects servers from Denial of Service (DDoS)
          attacks.
